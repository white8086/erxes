My two biggest ones prior to TUF were Stork and the Seattle Testbed. Stork is a package manager that was designed to work well in environments with lots of OSVMs running on shared hardware similar to a normal server / desktop. I started the project back in 2002, when this environment was much more rare. \u201cThe cloud\u201d wasn\u2019t a buzzword I heard until much later, but Stork was really the first package manager expressly designed to work in the cloud."),Object(r.b)("p",null,"I started the Seattle testbed project in 2008 as a \u201cfog computing\u201d platform, which is like cloud environment, but running on edge devices like laptops, smartphones, wireless routers, etc. At its peak, we had about 35K systems you could run software on. One cool thing is that we basically abstracted away all of the platform differences so you didn\u2019t even know if you were on a Macbook, a one-laptop-per-child with a hand crank, a Nokia N800 phone, a beefy Linux server, a Windows Mobile phone, etc. \u2014 your code just worked and masked the OS differences from you. More than 100 different developers (most of them students) contributed to the code. While we still use the code ourselves internally for projects and educational purposes, we officially retired the project a few years ago. The NSF (National Science Foundation) had kindly helped to support it for many years, but in the end we struggled to find enough funding to maintain it. I had a student who worked on that project contact me and say that they had looked 8+ years later to see how others had solved some of the OS portability problems we worked on in that project and that what we had done was still state-of-the-art and unique.

A lot of students worked on my lab\u2019s projects, some of whom are absolutely excellent. However, many who are still learning also become solid contributors after a little while getting up to speed.

With Stork (2002-2009), this was really my first project where I realized the value and difficulties in including a lot of outside help. I had about 20 different undergraduate researchers working on the project with me at one time or another. I wrote a first working draft of almost all of the original code (with tests and comments) and then had students help to flesh out corner cases, add features, etc. However, I was not rigorous about what form the contributions were in and very quickly there became dark corners of the code where we were hesitant to change for fear of breaking something.

That was compounded by the fact the Seattle Testbed\u2019s programming model was a little different, in part to deal with the OS differences. I am not sure to what extent those lessons still hold today, but this wasn\u2019t obvious 2ish years into that project when we were roughly doubling in size every year.

Their adoption really helped to make visible some usability challenges and forced us to formalize some less precise parts of TUF.
